# Snake-and-ladder-python
This is a Python implementation of the Snake and Ladder game featuring a board visualization.

Game Description:
The Snake and Ladder game is played with two players. The objective of the game is to reach the top of the board by climbing ladders and avoiding snakes. If a player lands at the bottom of a ladder, they climb up to the corresponding higher position. On the other hand, if a player lands on the head of a snake, they slide down to the corresponding lower position. The first player to reach the top of the board wins the game.

Let's have fun playing the Snake and Ladder game!
